To set up an Eclipse project for Assignment 3
================================================================

Note: these are essentially the same instructions as for Assignment 2,
except that there is no parser to build.

- Run Eclipse.
  - Select (or create) a workspace folder.
    - (Close the "Welcome" window if it is open)
  - New -> Project ... Java ... Java Project
  - Next
  - Project name: asst3
    - Create new project in workspace
    - JRE: should be at least 1.6
    - Project layout: create separate ...
    - Finish
  - Unzip the starter file, creating the folder asst3Starter
  - Drag all folders from asst3Starter/src onto the 'src' icon in the package
    explorer.
    - if it asks, select "copy files and folders", here and elsewhere
      during this setup process
  - Drag the asst3Starter/lib folder onto the 'asst3' icon in the package
    explorer
  - Drag the test file, TestSimp.java onto the 'asst3' icon in the packae
    explorer.
  - Drag the asst3Starter/jars folder onto the 'asst3' icon in the package
    explorer
  - Set up the lib file by:
    - click on the 'asst3' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add ClassFolder ...
    - click on the check-box that corresponds to lib under the asst3 project
    - OK
    - OK
  - Set up the WrangLR JAR file by:
    - click on the 'asst3' icon in the package explorer.
    - Project -> Properties
    - Java Build Path
    - Libraries tab
    - Add JARs ...
    - open up 'asst3', then 'jars' in the pop-up window
    - click on wrangLRv0_8.jar (or whatever the JAR file name is) in the
      pop-up window
    - OK
    - OK

================================================================
Running the Project
================================================================
- right-click on Main3.java under src/main
- Run As -> Java Application
  - The first time WrangLR will report that is needs a file-name argument, so
    add one:
    - Run -> Run Configurations ...
    - make sure that 'Main3' is selected in the left pane
    - Arguments tab
    - Type in the name of the input file followed by "-w" (or "pp") into the
      "Program arguments:" text-field. (E.g., "TestSimp.java -w".)
      - if successful, it will bring up a window that displays the AST
    - Eclipse will remember this argument, so you don't need to do this
      step unless you want to change argument.
